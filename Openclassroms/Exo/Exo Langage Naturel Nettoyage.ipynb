\" without the crowds , you can enjoy step - right - up service at tourist offices and experience a more @entity1 . although many popular tourist - oriented parks , shows and tours will be closed , off - season is in - season for the high culture : plays and operas are in their crowd - pleasing glory . for instance , in @entity101 , while the @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 are scarce in the summer , all have a busy schedule of performances through the rest of the year . @entity1 \\'s major cities crackle with energy year - round . in @entity108 , you can spend your days at the @entity109 and @entity110 , and your nights at a cozy pub or a world - class play . in @entity10 -- the @entity10 that always sparkles -- you can get face - to - face with @entity117 and scale the @entity118 . in @entity119 , you \\'ll see @entity121 paintings and @entity122 without peak - season crowds . but winter travel has its drawbacks . because much of @entity1 is in @entity127 latitudes , the days are short . it \\'s dark by 5 p.m. the weather can be miserable -- cold , windy , and drizzly -- and then turn worse . but just as summer can be wet and gray , winter can be crisp and blue , and even into mid-november , hillsides blaze with colorful leaves . to thrive in the winter , you \\'ll need to get the most out of your limited daylight hours . start early and eat a quick lunch . pack for the cold and wet -- layers , rainproof parka , gloves , wool hat , long johns , waterproof shoes and an umbrella . use undershirts to limit the washing of slow - drying heavy shirts . dress warmly . cold weather is colder when you \\'re outdoors trying to enjoy yourself all day long . and cheap hotels are not always adequately heated in the off - season . off - season hours are limited . tourist information offices normally stay open year - round but have shorter hours in the winter . while most sights stay open through the winter , they typically operate on shorter schedules ( such as 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. rather than 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. ) , with darkness often determining the closing time . winter sightseeing is fine in big cities , which bustle year - round , but it \\'s more frustrating in small tourist towns , which often close down entirely . in december many beach resorts are shut up as tight as canned hams . while @entity1 \\'s wonderful outdoor evening ambience survives year - round in the south , wintertime streets are empty in the north after dark . english - language tours , common in the summer , are rare during the off - season , when most visitors are natives . another disadvantage of winter travel is loneliness . the solo traveler wo n\\'t have the built - in camaraderie of other travelers that he or she would find in peak season . still , this can be a plus , since it encourages you to really connect with the locals you traveled halfway around the world to meet . regardless of when you go , if your objective is to \" meet the people , \" you \\'ll find @entity1 filled with them 365 days a year . @entity192 writes @entity1 travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio . e-mail him at @entity198 , or write to him c / o @entity199 2009 , @entity200 , @entity201 . 98020 . copyright 2007 @entity192 , @entity202 , @entity204 e-mail to a friend\\n\\n@entity192 produces 30 guidebooks on @placeholder travel\\n\\n@entity1\\n\\n@entity117:Mona\\n@entity81:Alps\\n@entity83:St. Mark \\'s Square\\n@entity110:National Gallery\\n@entity119:Florence\\n@entity118:Eiffel Tower\\n@entity1:European\\n@entity0:Tribune Media Services\\n@entity211:Europe Through the Back Door\\n@entity199:P.O.
