def get_board_value(board: Board) -> float:
    """Computes the board value for the current player.

    The board value captures how are we currently performing, compared to the opponent. Each player's partial board
    value assesses the player's situation, taking into account their current kore, ship count, shipyard count
    (including their max spawn) and kore carried by fleets. We then define the board value as the difference between
    player's partial board values.
    Flight plans and the positioning of fleet and shipyards do not flow into the board value (yet).

    To keep things simple, we'll take a weighted sum as the partial board value. We need weighting since
    the importance of each item changes over time. We don't need to have the most kore at the beginning of the game,
    but we do at the end. Ship count won't help us win games in the latter stages, but it is crucial in the beginning.
    Fleets and shipyards will be accounted for proportionally to their kore cost.

    For efficiency, the weight factors are pre-computed at module level. Here is the logic behind the weighting:
    WEIGHTS_KORE: Applied to the player's kore count. Increases linearly from 0 to 1. It reaches one before
        the maximum game length is reached.
    WEIGHTS_ASSETS: Applied to fleets and shipyards. Decreases linearly from 1 to 0 and reaches zero before the maximum
        length. It emphasizes the need of having ships over kore at the beginning of the game.
    WEIGHTS_MAX_SPAWN: Shipyard value is multiplied by its max spawn. This captures the idea that long-held shipyards
        are more valuable.
    WEIGHTS_KORE_IN_FLEETS: Kore in fleets should be valued, too. But its value must be upper-bounded by WEIGHTS_KORE
        (it can never be better to have kore in cargo than home) and it must decrease in time, since it doesn't
        count towards the end kore count.

    Args:
        board: The board for which we want to compute the value.

    Returns:
        The value of the board.
